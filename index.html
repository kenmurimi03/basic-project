                                <p>We bring in boys at 11-years-old and invest in them for the next 7+ years of their life, by providing elite soccer training, a quality education through our independent school, mentorship and leadership training, and a loving home at our academy residence. Our boys are moving on to exciting opportunities in professional football, full university scholarships, and local jobs. It would be amazing if one of our players became the next great soccer star, but our real hope is that through their mentorship and education, they will become great fathers, community leaders, and role models. </p>

                            <p>We believe that creating the right culture and environment is crucial in raising the next generation of great leaders. Our five Ubuntu values underpin all that we do, providing coaches, staff, and players a clear reference point to the type of men we want to develop.  Weekly life-skill and Bible studies based on these values help coaches and players apply them on a very practical level in their lives. Each term, our badge system rewards players living out the values in their community, school, as well as on the football field.

Furthermore, the Academy has the facilities to allow for English Language and training courses.

                                The high-quality accommodation available at the Academy features en-suite rooms, study areas, games rooms and on-site kitchen. The accommodation is highly supervised and run to a professional football club standard, and all of the highly-trained staff hold the relevant qualifications and child protection policies.
