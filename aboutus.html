                                <p>Our mission is to mentor and educate the next generation of great African leaders, society-changers, and footballers.</p>

                                <h1 class="h2">OUR VISION</h1>
                                <p>Our vision is to see positive people of influence leading healthy families, flourishing communities, and thriving nations.</p>

                                <h1 class="h2">WHY IT WAS FORMED</h1>
                                <p>Acakoro Football was born in 2011 in response to a crisis of fatherlessness in South African society, where 60% of children are growing up without a father in their home. The lack of positive, male role models is a root cause of cycles of alcoholism, drug addiction, gender inequality, corruption, and more. We want every child leaving Ubuntu to be holistically mentored to be a leader, professionally developed to be a footballer, and uniquely educated to reach their academic potential. </p>
                        </div></br></br>

                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                                <h1 class="h2">OUR PROGRAMS</h1>
                                <p>All of our programs prioritize character and leadership development. Our Skills Schools, located at four different sites around Cape Town, are our private coaching initiatives for footballers aged 7-12. Players connect with coaches, participate in drills and skills training, and benefit from mentorship and short life skills lessons during each session. Acakoro Football host trials every year in October for U9-U11 players.  Footballers selected after this tough process will be invited into either our Football Forward program or our U12 Academy Team.  We are not looking to recruit players aged 12 and older and will not be hosting trials for these ages in the future. 

                                        For players successfully making it through the trial process, the Acakoro Football Academy offers holistic mentorship to exceptional young players over a sustained period of six years (12-18 years-old). Each day at the academy we provide education through our own Academy School, elite football training, ongoing mentorship through our various character formation programs, and an Academy Residence for 27 of our boys to call home.  The boys in our residence benefit from a safe and stable environment: they are cared for by our loving House Parents and staff, are provided with delicious meals by our Cooking Manager, and build deep relationships with their mentors and peers.  All of our programs help us in our goal of seeking to raise a generation of young men who impact our nation.  We want to see young men who have dreams of not just football, but also for careers and passions when they stop playing or pursuing professional football.</p>
